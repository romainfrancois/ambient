Description: Generation of natural looking noise has many application within 
    simulation, procedural generation, and art, to name a few. The 'ambient' 
    package provides an interface to the 'FastNoise' C++ library and allows for
    efficient generation of perlin, simplex, worley, cubic, value, and white 
    noise with optional pertubation in either 2, 3, or 4 (in case of simplex and
    white noise) dimensions.
